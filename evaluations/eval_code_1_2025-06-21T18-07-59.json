    "gpt-4": "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the creation of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data. It involves the construction of models that can predict future instances based on past instances.\n\nDeep Learning, on the other hand, is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with several layers (deep neural networks) to model and understand complex patterns in datasets. It uses a layered structure of algorithms called neural networks to learn and make intelligent decisions. It is designed to mimic the human brain's way of learning, thus considered a step closer to artificial intelligence.",
    "gpt-3.5-turbo": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training a model to make predictions or decisions based on data. It relies on algorithms and statistical models to learn patterns from the data without being explicitly programmed.\n\nDeep learning is a specific type of machine learning that involves using artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns from the data. Deep learning models are capable of automatically learning features and hierarchies in data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as image and speech recognition.\n\nIn summary, deep learning is a more advanced and complex form of machine learning that uses deep neural networks to learn and extract patterns from data."
